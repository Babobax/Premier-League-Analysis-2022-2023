# Premier-League-Analysis-2022-2023

This is the analysis of the English Football Premier League season 2022/2023. During the analysis we explore many different aspects of football played this season like progressive playing, over/underperforming of certain players, age distribution among players and so on.

I'll keep updating the project until the season is over and no new data about it is collected anymore, so it's not outdated.

Project was completed in Python and it's packages (pandas, numpy, beautifulsoup4, matplotlib, seaborn) listed also in the Jupyter Notebook file.

**Update 19/05/23**:
- Collected updated dataset and freshened the report based on the new data.

Enjoy!
